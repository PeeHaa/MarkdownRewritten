PHP Markdown Rewritten
======================

A rewrite of the [PHP Markdown][1] class by [Michel Fortin][2].

Which in turn is a port to PHP of the original Markdown by [John Gruber][3].

The original port works great, however the code is a bit of an outdated mess (sorry Michel).

In it's current form this cannot be used yet until I'm finished with the rewrite.

All credits should go to both John Gruber and Michel Fortin for doing all the work  
since I'm just cleaning it up.
